# Election_Analysis



## Project Overview


## Resources
- Data Sources: election_results.csv
- Software: [Python 3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Summary
The Analysis of the election shows that:
1. The total votes casted for the election was 369,711.

2. The number of candidates running in this election is three with the following names:
   - Candidate #1: Charles Casper Stockham
   - Candidate #2: Diana DeGette
   - Candidate #3: Raymon Anthony Doane

3. The candidate results were:
   - Candidate #1 recieved 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
   - Candidate #2 recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
   - Candidate #3 recieved 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.

5. The comprehensive analysis of these election can be extended to larger projects such as gatherings at national and international levels. 
by enlarging the loops of iteration, creating nested loops and using conditional statements on influential factors, wider analyzes will be possible.

## Challenge Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to reinforce the Python programming insight by using VBA background. In fact, we performed a simulation for obtaining the winner county of what
has been done before. We used Python as well as Visual studio code softwares for excecuting our script. 
Python, while simple, is very practical and intuitive, thus it can be used as an effective computational tool for macro-analysis.
Preliminary information is available in this election that is related to the list of candidates and their total votes along with 
the winner of the election based on the highest percentage of the votes. In order to complete the rest of the information related to 
this project, determining the share of participating of each county and selecting the winning county has a significient role in clarifying for the audiences. 
Therefore, the purpose of this analysis audit is to calculate the voter turnout and the percentage of votes of each county in order to
determining the county with the highest turnout.

## Challenge Summary
In fact, the presented challenge is an example of hundreds of samples that we encounter in the real world. Problem analysis in the form of a flowchart
and pseudo-code gives us an extensive information.
Knowing what we want to do and what our goal is supposed to be, is the most important step in starting this analysis, and then advancing the problem in the direction of goal
using important tools such as Python is the next step in achieving the result of the data analysis.
